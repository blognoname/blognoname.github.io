    </header><p>There aren&rsquo;t many patterns for men out there and most of what there is is just relatively standard shirts or trousers, maybe even a waistcoat.
So finding something interesting to make can be a bit of a struggle. To aid this struggle just a tiny bit, I thought I&rsquo;d give my thoughts on a recent pattern I made.</p>
<p><strong>The Cornell shirt by Elbe Textiles</strong></p>
<p>This is an oversized drop-shoulder shirt with a half-placket front (although the pattern does also include a normal &ldquo;split&rdquo; shirt). I was a little sceptical about the drop shoulder at first.
I didn&rsquo;t want to look like an eight year old trying on his dad&rsquo;s shirt, but after wearing it around for a few days I am converted.</p>
<p><img id="col" src="/cornell/1_c.jpg" width=30% /><img id="col" src="/cornell/2.jpg"  width=30% /><img id="col" src="/cornell/3.jpg"  width=30% /></p>
<p>The collar is quite interesting too, laying flat across the neck and breast, not like a usual collar that stands up.</p>
<p>The acid tests are:</p>
<ul>
<li>will I wear this shirt?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>would I make this again?</li>
</ul>
<p>and the answer is yes to both!</p>
<p>I made the sleeve plackets longer so make rolling up the sleeves easier and cut about 3cm off the bottom of the hem, other than that I followed the pattern instructions. Overall the instructions are very good and clear, but there are a few gripes.
When attaching the sleeves, there is supposed to be a notch on the shoulder to line up with the centre of the sleeve, but this notch is nowhere on the pattern pieces. I aligned the centre sleeve with the shoulder seam and this seems to make the shirt sit too far back on my shoulders, next time I will put the centre sleeve back from the shoulder seam.</p>
<p>Unfortunately I messed up slightly the cuffs, nothing dramatic but they are not as neat as I would like. I put this down to the prescribed method of attaching the cuffs being somewhat finicky. The cuff is first attached to the sleeve, then the cuff edges are sewn up.
I found it difficult to sew a seam lined up the sleeve placket edge. I prefer to make the cuff completely and then attach it to the sleeve but this is just my preference.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t have your wits about you, you&rsquo;ll end up with a shirt that has right-over-left buttons. For some reason this is how women&rsquo;s shirts are made, with men&rsquo;s being left-over-right.
Having buttoned up my shirts my whole life left-over-right, it would feel very alien to do it the wrong way around, so I mirrored the placket relative to the instructions.</p>
<p>I hope the folks at Elbe make some more cool stuff soon!</p>
