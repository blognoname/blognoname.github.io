    </header><p>A while ago I got this book of Japanese book of men&rsquo;s patterns.</p>
<p>I have sewn a few things from it already and I also made a little video about the book.</p>
<p>In short - I recommend!</p>
<p>The book contains some dozen patterns that will give you a whole wardrobe. That&rsquo;s not bad value! I got my copy for around 35EUR with postage from Japan, whereas you won&rsquo;t get much change out of 20EUR for just one shirt pattern from a western designer.
There is however some work to be done. The pattern pieces are printed very sparingly on several sheets of paper that look like a spaghetti of lines and marks. You have to trace these patterns onto some paper. This process can take a while and is tedious - a good rainy afternoon activity.</p>
<p>The book is of course all written in japanese, but google translate on a phone can help you! At least sometimes it helps, othertimes it just translates nonesense&hellip;. I&rsquo;m sad that I can&rsquo;t read and understand japanese because there are some interesting looking &ldquo;lessons&rdquo; in the book that teach you how to adjust pattern pieces for fit, how to sew a button fly and a few more.</p>
<p>There are neat diagrams showing the construction details, but sometimes it can be hard to get your head around how the garment is meant to go together. I really recommend making a toille.</p>
<p>Sometime soon I will write about the patterns that I have made from this book.</p>
<p>Scouring on the internet shows that there are many books like this from several different designers that should also be worth looking at.</p>
