    </header><p>A while ago I made the <a href="/10-elbe-cornell-shirt">Elbe Cornell shirt</a>, it was nice but as I wore it more and more, I noticed that the collar kept slipping down my back. This got annoying and a little uncomfortable, until I decided to do something about it.</p>
<p>Some searching revealed that I probably needed a forward shoulder adjustment. This happens when you have crappy posture and are on your way to becoming a humpback. The good news is that if you know how to sew, you needn&rsquo;t worry about ill fitting clothes.</p>
<p>Basically because the shoulders are more rounded, the yoke needs to be lengthened so that it can cover the whole back of the shoulders.</p>
<p>Many guides that I saw envolved altering the armscye and frankly seemed rather complicated, like cutting a slit down the centre of the yoke and then spreading the slit apart to make the yoke taller.
Because the shirt has a very loose fit, I figured that the armscye shape, general fit and such weren&rsquo;t super crucial, so I decided simply on extending the centre of the shirt back in the middle by about 4cm, see sketch below. The 4cm I got by making a toile and experimenting.</p>

<p>After I was happy with my toile, I ripped most of the shirt apart (I would&rsquo;ve just made a new shirt from scratch but I didn&rsquo;t have enough of the same fabric. and I LOVE this fabric) to sew in the new back piece.
The first iteraton was size B. The second I sized down to size A. I also took this opportunity to lengthen the sleeves by 6cm, yes this is a lot but I have long arms.</p>
<p>The end result works nicely, the shirt is super comfy, no longer drags itself backwards and the sleeves are long enough!</p>
<p>So if you want to sew this shirt, I&rsquo;d definitely recomment making a toile first to check out the fit.</p>
