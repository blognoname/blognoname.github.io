    </header><p>Looking for a lighter weight sewing machine, I stumbled across the Singer Featherweight. This is a really nice, small, but proper sewing machine.
In contrast to most older machines, it&rsquo;s body is made from aluminium not steel, meaning that it weighs around 6 kilos - perfect for my purpose!</p>
<p>To solve the electricity problem, I bought a small 300W inverter that runs from a 12V battery.</p>
<p>After much measuring, drilling and screwing (not that kind) here is the result</p>
<img class="special-img-class" src="/bike3.jpg"  width=60% /> 
<p>The inverter is mounted on the underside of the wooden board, and the battery is lazily resting on the floor.</p>
<p>This set up works very well and I spent a few happy afternoons sat by the river making some pencil cases and shopping bags.
Many of what one might term ladies of a gentler disposition showed great interest in my contraption.</p>
<p>However I am still not entirely satisfied - when I am riding I really can feel the weight of the machine dragging me back.
I think that it would be possible to replace the motor for a DC-motor, thus eliminating the need for an inverter and perhaps even shaving off a few grams with a lighter motor.</p>
