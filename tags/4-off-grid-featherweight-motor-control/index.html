    </header><p>The Singer featherweight is a fantastic little machine, but for carting around on the back of a bike, it is just a little bit heavy.
One area that could benefit from some nip &rsquo;n&rsquo; tuck is the rather beefy motor, weighing in at around 750 gramms on my machine. If I can replace this with a DC motor, also won&rsquo;t need the inverter anymore. The original foot-pedal won&rsquo;t work with a DC motor, so I will need a new one.
This is not a big deal because the foot-pedal is a bit too well constructed for my purposes anyway.
Between the motor, foot-pedal and inverter, I expect the machine to lose about a kilo, which when cycling uphill could make all the difference.</p>
<p>There are 3 parts to this conversion:</p>
<ul>
<li>the electronics to control the motor&rsquo;s speed</li>
<li>the design of the foot-pedal</li>
<li>mounting the new motor and making it drive the machine</li>
</ul>
<p>which I will talk about separately.
But, take warning, although I may try to give the impression that everything was planned and thought out in a careful and compartmentalised manner, really it was a series of failed and retuned attempts.</p>
<p>Now its time to think about how to control a DC motor on my sewing machine. I need to have some kind of electronic circuit that is able to vary the speed of the motor nice and smoothly.
Ideally that circuit will be matched perfectly to a foot-pedal in order to achieve the smooth control. I know hardly anything about electronics but I haven&rsquo;t been electrocuted (yet).</p>
<p>Unfortunately, most of the motor control circuits that float around on google limit the current or voltage to get the motor to turn slowly. This is not ideal for a sewing machine as it means that when the motor is running slowly, it&rsquo;s power is reduced, just at the point where you don&rsquo;t want it to be - this might cause the machine to stall.
Some circuits claim to beat this problem, but they were way too complicated for me to be able to solder together. I did consider employing a stepper motor, which doesn&rsquo;t suffer from this problem. Some folks have managed to put stepper motors on sewing machines to make DIY embroidery robots: pretty cool.
The downside of a stepper is that you need a driver circuit and they are heavier and more expensive - you win some and you lose some.</p>
<p>So keeping my DC motor I cobbled together a small pulse-width-modulation circuit that actually worked the first time.
This works by turning the electricity to the motor on and off very quickly at a varying speed to alter the motor&rsquo;s speed.
My circuit used a potentiometer, essentially a knob that you turn to control the motor.
Now the problem is converting the curved-arc motion of your foot pressing a pedal into the rotary motion needed to turn the potentiometer.</p>
<p>Cue sequence of 3D-printing many foot pedal designs from thingiverse&hellip;</p>
<p>Most of these designs used a curved gear to interface with a gear on the potentiometer. I found that in practice this interfacing was tricky to make reliable and wasn&rsquo;t happy with any of the designs I saw as they seemed either too complicated to be reliable or not strong enough.
I thought about buying a linear potentiometer, but that remained just a thought.</p>
<p>Then I stumbled across several designs for foot-pedals to be used in racing simulator games that seemed sturdy and simple to build
. Instead of a pedal that where the pedal pivots around a hinge, a lever presses on a surface that is free to move around.
Instead of the pedal moving in an arc, it moved in a straight line. I still had to find a way of turning the potentiometer.</p>
<p>That was until I realised that in a cordless drill, the required circuitry to make a motor go fast and slow is already there, and even better, it is controlled by a trigger that moves in a linear motion.
The drill trigger is already neatly mounted in a little box so I really don&rsquo;t have to do all that much - always the best solution.
It is then not so hard to cannibalise a cordless drill and fit the control circuit into the 3D-printed foot-pedal. Essentially my sewing machine becomes just a glorified cordless drill.</p>

<p>A piece of 4-stranded wire (two for the battery and two for the motor) runs from the pedal to the machine, where it connects to a DIN socket mounted onto the machine.
The battery then connects to a separate barrel-jack next to the pedal socket. I managed to 3D print an near perfect copy of the original plug that can house the two connectors which I am very pleased with.</p>

<p>Now its time to think about how to fasten the motor to the machine and get it all turning.</p>
